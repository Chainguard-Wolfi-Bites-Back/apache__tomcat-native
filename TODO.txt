                        TODO


SSL Renegotiation
-----------------

It is unclear to me, what the current state is. It looks like we support
the unsafe legacy reneg whenever the OpenSSL used during build time
supports it. There is no configuration option to switch it off during
runtime. Right?

Is it correct, that client initiated reneg is not supported and thus the
known attacks will not work even with old OpenSSL?

Should we add a remark about this topic to the docs?


Java Classes Source Distribution
--------------------------------

Check on how to handle the test classes.
I think they have no other home.


Releasing
---------

- Document how to release.

- Add info about updating config.guess and config.sub from 

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD

- ZIP download seems to have group write permissions set
  (at least after I extract it on Solaris).
  It's a bit strange that permissions differ between the
  tar and zip archives.
